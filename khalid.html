        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <P>I am Khaled Hosseini, an Afghan-born American novelist and <br>
             I was born on March 4, 1965, in Kabul, Afghanistan. <br>
             <br>
             My family sought asylum in the United States after the Soviet invasion in 1979. <br>
             My debut novel, "The Kite Runner" (2003), became an international bestseller, <br>
              followed by "A Thousand Splendid Suns" (2007) and "And the Mountains Echoed" (2013). <br>
              My works often explore themes of friendship, betrayal, <br>
               and the socio-political landscape of Afghanistan. <br>
               I also serve as a goodwill envoy for <br>
                the UNHCR and established the Khaled Hosseini Foundation to aid Afghan refugees.</P>
